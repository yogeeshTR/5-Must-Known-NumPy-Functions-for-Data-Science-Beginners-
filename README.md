**5-Must-Known-NumPy-Functions-for-Data-Science**

NumPy or Numerical Python is a commonly used Python data analysis package.By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. Here some features and applications of Numpy library.

**Features**
1. Provides fast, precompiled functions for numerical routines
2. Array-oriented computing for better efficiency
3. Supports an object-oriented approach
4. Compact and faster computations with vectorization

**Applications:**
1. Extensively used in data analysis
2. Creates powerful N-dimensional array
3. Forms the base of other libraries, such as SciPy and scikit-learn
4. Replacement of MATLAB when used with SciPy and matplotlib

Here am picking some of the Functions which are very useful for analysing the data, They are

1. **numpy.reshape()**
2. **numpy.where()**
3. **numpy.zeros()**
4. **numpy.random.rand()**
5. **numpy.tile()**
